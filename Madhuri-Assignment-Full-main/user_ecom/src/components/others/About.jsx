              I have been working online for the last 7 years and have created
              several successful websites running on the internet. I create
              project-based courses that help you learn professionally and make
              you feel like a complete developer. easy learning exists to help
              you succeed in life.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mt-4">
              Each course has been hand-tailored to teach a specific skill. I
              hope you agree! Whether you’re trying to learn a new skill from
              scratch or want to refresh your memory on something you’ve learned
              in the past, you’ve come to the right place. Education makes the
              world a better place. Make your world better with new skills.
